Project Overview
The rise in unsolicited spam messages necessitates automated solutions for filtering. This project uses machine learning to build a classifier capable of detecting spam in SMS messages. By applying various classification algorithms, the goal is to achieve high accuracy in differentiating between spam and ham messages.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a tab-separated file (SMSSpam.csv), containing 5,572 SMS messages with two columns:

labels: "spam" or "ham"
message: The actual content of the SMS
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/venkataravi700/Spam_classification.git
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Ensure you have the dataset train.csv in the project directory.

Usage
Load the dataset and explore the data:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
dataset = pd.read_csv('train.csv', sep='\t', names=['labels', 'message'])
Preprocess the SMS data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.) and split it into training and test sets.

Train a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine) to classify the SMS messages.

Evaluate the model on the test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Model
The project utilizes machine learning classifiers to identify spam messages. Key steps include:

Preprocessing the text data (removing stopwords, tokenizing, etc.)
Converting the text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF
Training classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM
Results
The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The results show promising accuracy, with potential for further improvements through parameter tuning and feature engineering.
